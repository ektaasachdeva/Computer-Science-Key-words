### 8. Data Structures
**Array: A collection of similar items stored in memory.**
**Linked List: A series of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.**
**Stack: A simple structure that works on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.**
**Queue: An ordered setup that adheres to the First In First Out (FIFO) rule. Hash Table A system that links keys to values for quick retrieval based on the key.**

## 9. Web Development:

**The frontend of a web app is what users see and interact with typically built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. On the hand the backend manages tasks like handling databases processing server functions and supporting app features. API stands for Application Programming Interface and it sets rules for how different software applications can communicate. DNS or Domain Name System is a service that translates domain names into IP addresses.**

## 10. Networking Concepts:

OSI Model The OSI model is a framework that breaks down functions into seven distinct layers for consistency. This includes the Application Layer 7 and the Physical Layer **1. Packets** These are segments of data sent over networks. Before transmission larger messages are split into packets and reassembled upon reaching their destination. 

**2. Port Number** A port number is an identifier assigned to different services or processes within a network. For example HTTP operates on port 80 while HTTPS uses port 443. 

**3. VPN A Virtual Private Network** is a service that creates a secure connection over the internet often used to protect privacy.

## 11. Programming Paradigms:

**OOP** stands for Object Oriented Programming and it is a coding method that centers on the concept of objects. These objects contain data and methods. Encapsulation involves bundling up methods and data within objects while restricting access to certain parts. 

**Abstraction** simplifies systems by using interfaces.

 **Inheritance** enables the formation of classes based on existing ones, to encourage code sharing. 
 
**Polymorphism** allows different classes to be treated as instances of a class through common interfaces.

## 12. Emerging Technologies:

**•  Binary:** A numbering system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Computers operate using binary code because they process data in the form of electrical signals, which can be in an "on" (1) or "off" (0) state.

**•  Bit:** The smallest unit of data in a computer, represented by a 0 or 1. It is the basic building block for data in computing and telecommunications.
